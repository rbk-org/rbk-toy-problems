1-Write a function myFavoriteSong which takes in no arguments (input values), 
but returns an object with the properties title, artist, 
and durationInSeconds. The values of each property is up to you, 
and you can explicitly type out these values, 
but these three properties should exist within the object your function returns.

function myFavoriteSong() {

myFavoriteSong(); //{title: "Countdown", artist: "Beyonce", durationInSeconds: 212}

when the busses come for the day.

function nextTwoBusTimes(timesArr) {

}
Calling your function should result in something like:

var bus10Schedule = [12, 24, 35, 47, 60];
nextTwoBusTimes(bus10Schedule); //"The next 2 busses arrive in 12 and 24 minutes."
*/

when the busses come for the day. 
Your function should return a string which denotes when the nearest bus arrives, and the last for the day.

function nextAndLastBusTimes(timesArr) {

}
Calling your function should result in something like:

var bus10Schedule = [12, 24, 35, 47, 60];
