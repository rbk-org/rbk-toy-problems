//1- Write a function isTallEnough that takes a height (number) in inches, 
//and returns true if the input is greater than or equal to 48, and false if it's less than 48 inches.
//Calling your function should result in:
<<<<<<< HEAD


function isTallEnough(height){
	if(height>=48){

//2- Write a function isGoodFreethrowShooter that takes a shooting percentage
// (a number you can assume will be between 0 and 1 -- exclusive of 1).
//and returns based on the following criteria:
// If the number is between 0-0.65, return "Horrible freethrow shooter"
// If the number is between 0.65-0.80 return "Decent freethrow shooter"
// If the number is between 0.80-1.00 return "Great freethrow shooter"
// Each range is inclusive of the lower bound, and exclusive of the upper -- in other words, 
//0.65 is counted as a "Decent freethrow shooter" (not "Horrible freethrow shooter") 
//and 0.80 is considered a "Great freethrow shooter" (not "Decent freethrow shooter"). 
//Additionally, you can get a number as high as 0.99, but never 1 
//(this is what the original problem statement means by "exclusive of 1").

// Calling your function should result in:

function isGoodFreethrowShooter(shooting){
	if(shooting>=0 ||shooting <0.65){
		return "Horrible freethrow shooter";
	}if(shooting>=0.65 || shooting<0.80){

		}if(shooting>=0.80 || shooting<1.0){
